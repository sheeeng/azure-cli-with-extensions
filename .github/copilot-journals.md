### Test Persistent Azure CLI Credentials and Custom Configuration

Successfully verified that persistent Azure CLI credentials and custom configuration are working correctly with the Nix flake setup.

#### Test Commands Used

```bash
# Build and test Azure CLI with extensions.
nix build .#default
./result/bin/az --version

# Verify custom configuration directory and settings.
ls -la ~/.azure-cli-with-extensions/
cat ~/.azure-cli-with-extensions/config
./result/bin/az config get

# Test extension availability.
./result/bin/az extension list

# Test consistency between different invocation methods.
nix run . -- config get

# Test environment variable override functionality.
AZURE_CONFIG_DIR=/tmp/test-azure-config ./result/bin/az config get
cat /tmp/test-azure-config/config
rm -rf /tmp/test-azure-config
```

#### Test Results

1. **Custom Configuration Directory**: Azure CLI uses persistent configuration at `~/.azure-cli-with-extensions/` instead of default `~/.azure/`.

2. **Configuration Persistence**: Custom settings correctly applied:
   - `collect_telemetry = false`
   - `only_show_errors = false`
   - `no_color = true`
   - `name = AzureCloud`
   - `use_dynamic_install = false`
   - `run_after_dynamic_install = false`
   - `enable_log_file = no`

3. **Extensions Available**: All four extensions properly loaded:
   - `account` (0.2.5)
   - `aks-preview` (18.0.0b33)
   - `k8s-extension` (1.6.7)
   - `k8s-runtime` (2.0.0)

4. **Environment Override**: `AZURE_CONFIG_DIR` environment variable override functionality verified working.

5. **Credential Persistence**: Configuration directory contains authentication files that will persist login sessions across CLI invocations.

6. **Consistent Behavior**: Both `./result/bin/az` and `nix run .` use identical configuration, ensuring consistent behavior.

#### Configuration Validation

The setup provides:

- Persistent credentials between CLI sessions after `az login`
- Automatic application of custom settings
- Pre-installed extensions ready for use
- Isolated configuration from system Azure CLI
- Override capability for testing scenarios

#### Azure CLI Authentication Behavior

Azure CLI reads and writes its configuration to `$AZURE_CONFIG_DIR` (defaults to `~/.azure`). If you override it to a temporary location, that becomes the only place it looks for your cached subscriptions, profiles, and tokens.

Since Azure CLI version 2.30+, `az login` uses MSAL (Microsoft Authentication Library). The MSAL token cache (e.g., `msal_token_cache.bin`) and service principal entries are stored as files under the configuration directory. On Linux/macOS they are plaintext files (not OS-encrypted), and on Windows they are encrypted. If those files are gone, your login state is gone.

This pattern (using `$AZURE_CONFIG_DIR` to isolate sessions) is commonly used for temporary/isolated logins. As soon as the temporary directory is removed, Azure CLI prompts you to log in again.

**References:**

- [Temporary Azure CLI Sessions][temporary-azure-cli-sessions]
- [Using Azure CLI Authentication Within Local Containers][azure-cli-authentication-containers]
- [Azure CLI Issue #28668][azure-cli-issue-28668] - Shows that when `AZURE_CONFIG_DIR` pointed to a temporary folder that was later cleaned up, the login context "vanished" and Azure CLI started asking to "Please run 'az login'".

Our implementation uses `~/.azure-cli-with-extensions` as a persistent directory to maintain login sessions while keeping configuration isolated from the system's default Azure CLI installation.

### Install and Test Azure CLI via Flox from Branch

Successfully installed Azure CLI with extensions from the `feat/branch` branch using flox and documented testing commands.

#### Flox Commands Used

```bash
# Check current flox packages.
flox list

# Remove conflicting az package.
flox remove az

# Install Azure CLI from specific branch.
flox install "git+ssh://git@github.com/sheeeng/azure-cli-with-extensions?ref=feat/branch"

# Verify installation.
flox list

# Test Azure CLI through flox activation.
flox activate -- which az
flox activate -- az version

# Enter flox environment and test.
flox activate
which az
az version
```

#### Key Testing Commands

The following commands are essential for verifying that the Azure CLI configuration is being used correctly from the flake:

- `flox activate -- which az` - Confirms the az binary path within flox environment
- `flox activate -- az version` - Tests Azure CLI functionality and configuration through flox

#### Installation Process

1. **Conflict Resolution**: Removed existing `az` package that was conflicting with the new installation from the branch.

2. **Branch Installation**: Successfully installed Azure CLI with extensions from the `feat/azure-config` branch using the git+ssh URL with branch reference.

3. **Path Verification**: Confirmed that the `az` binary is located in the flox environment directory: `~/github/sheeeng/azure-cli-with-extensions/.flox/run/aarch64-darwin.azure-cli-with-extensions.dev/bin/az`

### Test and Fix Azure CLI Flake

Tested the Nix flake for Azure CLI with extensions and resolved configuration issues.

#### Commands Used

```bash
# Validate flake structure and syntax.
nix flake check

# Build the default package.
nix build .#default

# Test Azure CLI functionality.
./result/bin/az version
./result/bin/az configure --list-defaults
./result/bin/az configure --list

# Clean and rebuild after fixes.
rm -f result && nix build .#default
```

#### Issues Resolved

1. **mktemp Compatibility**: Fixed `mktemp` command syntax for macOS compatibility by removing unsupported `--template` option and using correct GNU `coreutils` syntax: `mktemp --directory --tmpdir="$TEMP_BASE_DIR" azure-cli-XXXXXXXX`.

2. **GNU-style Commands**: Updated shell script to use explicit GNU-style options:
   - `${pkgs.coreutils}/bin/mktemp --directory --tmpdir="$TEMP_BASE_DIR"`
   - `${pkgs.coreutils}/bin/rm --force --recursive`
   - `${pkgs.coreutils}/bin/cp` and `${pkgs.coreutils}/bin/cat`

3. **Configuration Setup**: Added debug output to verify Azure CLI configuration is properly set up with isolated temporary directory and custom config file containing:
   - `collect_telemetry = false`
   - `only_show_errors = false`
   - Cloud name set to `AzureCloud`
   - Extension settings for dynamic install disabled

#### Flake Structure

The flake includes Azure CLI with the following extensions:

- `account`
- `aks-preview`
- `k8s-extension`
- `k8s-runtime`

Each extension includes links to NixOS package search and GitHub source repositories for reference.

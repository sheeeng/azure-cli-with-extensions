### Install and Test Azure CLI via Flox from Branch

Successfully installed Azure CLI with extensions from the `feat/branch` branch using flox and documented testing commands.

#### Flox Commands Used

```bash
# Check current flox packages.
flox list

# Remove conflicting az package.
flox remove az

# Install Azure CLI from specific branch.
flox install "git+ssh://git@github.com/sheeeng/azure-cli-with-extensions?ref=feat/branch"

# Verify installation.
flox list

# Test Azure CLI through flox activation.
flox activate -- which az
flox activate -- az version

# Enter flox environment and test.
flox activate
which az
az version
```

#### Key Testing Commands

The following commands are essential for verifying that the Azure CLI configuration is being used correctly from the flake:

- `flox activate -- which az` - Confirms the az binary path within flox environment
- `flox activate -- az version` - Tests Azure CLI functionality and configuration through flox

#### Installation Process

1. **Conflict Resolution**: Removed existing `az` package that was conflicting with the new installation from the branch.

2. **Branch Installation**: Successfully installed Azure CLI with extensions from the `feat/azure-config` branch using the git+ssh URL with branch reference.

3. **Path Verification**: Confirmed that the `az` binary is located in the flox environment directory: `~/github/sheeeng/azure-cli-with-extensions/.flox/run/aarch64-darwin.azure-cli-with-extensions.dev/bin/az`

### Test and Fix Azure CLI Flake

Tested the Nix flake for Azure CLI with extensions and resolved configuration issues.

#### Commands Used

```bash
# Validate flake structure and syntax.
nix flake check

# Build the default package.
nix build .#default

# Test Azure CLI functionality.
./result/bin/az version
./result/bin/az configure --list-defaults
./result/bin/az configure --list

# Clean and rebuild after fixes.
rm -f result && nix build .#default
```

#### Issues Resolved

1. **mktemp Compatibility**: Fixed `mktemp` command syntax for macOS compatibility by removing unsupported `--template` option and using correct GNU `coreutils` syntax: `mktemp --directory --tmpdir="$TEMP_BASE_DIR" azure-cli-XXXXXXXX`.

2. **GNU-style Commands**: Updated shell script to use explicit GNU-style options:
   - `${pkgs.coreutils}/bin/mktemp --directory --tmpdir="$TEMP_BASE_DIR"`
   - `${pkgs.coreutils}/bin/rm --force --recursive`
   - `${pkgs.coreutils}/bin/cp` and `${pkgs.coreutils}/bin/cat`

3. **Configuration Setup**: Added debug output to verify Azure CLI configuration is properly set up with isolated temporary directory and custom config file containing:
   - `collect_telemetry = false`
   - `only_show_errors = false`
   - Cloud name set to `AzureCloud`
   - Extension settings for dynamic install disabled

#### Flake Structure

The flake includes Azure CLI with the following extensions:

- `account`
- `aks-preview`
- `k8s-extension`
- `k8s-runtime`

Each extension includes links to NixOS package search and GitHub source repositories for reference.
